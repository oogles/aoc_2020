Advent of Code 2020
===================

My `Advent of Code 2020 <https://adventofcode.com/2020>`_ solutions in Python 3.

Each day's puzzle is found in the ``puzzles/`` directory, in a subdirectory named for the day it belongs to, using the structure defined by my Advent of Code runner/helper, https://github.com/oogles/aoc_base.

To run a solution for a given day, e.g. day 1, use::

    python3 run.py 1

To run all solutions, use::

    python3 run.py --all
